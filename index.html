           <p class="title2">During my time as a Digital Labs Intern, I was introduced to QA testing frameworks - more particularly, front-end test automation for web applications. I used Protractor and Selenium frameworks to generate multiple automated testing scripts for a Protractor Automated UI Test for the client dashboard. My efforts introduced automation testing for the Digital Labs team.</p>

Through the Java code written via the Cucumber and Gherkin tools, I was able to partially automate this process, introducing the software automation testing for this specific purpose</p>
