        <p>Priorly known as MorphoTrust USA, during my time as a Digital Labs Intern, I was introduced to QA testing frameworks - more particularly, front-end test automation for web applications. While gaining experience of automation engineering from a technical 'testing' perspective, I learned about the practices and standards that a web application must be tested and thus, delivered at. </p>

      <div class="columnl" style="background-color:#C7CFEA;">
        <p>While interning at IDEMIA, I automated the entirety of several web-pages for the IdentoGO product : a website/product used to verify and issue government state IDs within the DMV/RMV services (now live in Massachusetts). During my time, I also acquired other automation testing skills besides web-pages such as the testing of PDFs and Excel sheets/CSV results and databases.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="columnl" style="background-color:#FCD4E1;">
        <p>Taking a slightly different route this summer, it was during this internship that I had the chance to research and develop several proof of concepts (PoCs) which were meant to introduce a new automation framework, tool, and approach for the Workforce Analytics team. The main goal was to parse two different reports, analyze the differences, and to push the results through a reporting framework. </p>
